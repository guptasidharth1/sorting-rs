Sorting [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wackywendell/sorting-rs.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/wackywendell/sorting-rs)
----

This is a set of sorting algorithms, written in Rust.

Currently written:

 * Bubblesort
 * Quicksort
 * Heapsort
 * Selection Sort
 * Shell Sort
 * Merge Sort

They are meant to be written simply, and therefore in an easy-to-read format.

See `src/algorithms.rs` for code. There are also tests in `src/tests.rs` and benchmarks in
`src/benchmarks.rs`.

Enjoy!
